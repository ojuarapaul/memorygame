# Memory game

This project is to create a web app of a Memory Game. I'll start with a 4x4 matrix (16 squares), using 8 diferent images.
I'll use HTML5, CSS3, JS ES6+ and, hopefully, React. 
Overtime, I'll probably update the game with levels and new images (probably thematic cliparts, such as dogs only, pets in general, etc).<br>
Another intersting add-on would be to time the game.<br>
As all of my web apps, it will be created from scratch (meaning, from zero), I won't, like, rewrite someone's code to do it faster.
